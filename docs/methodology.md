# üìä Methodology: Exploring Global Development Indicators (2000‚Äì2020)

## 1. üì• Data Collection

### The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), specifically a [public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelmatta0/global-development-indicators-2000-2020) on global development indicators from 2000 to 2020. This dataset includes a wide range of socio-economic, environmental, and governance indicators across countries and regions. 

### I plan to explore the data to understand how these different indicators are interconnected, and later analyse the effect they have on Life Expectancy.

## 2. üßπ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### Initial data preparation was conducted using Power Query in Excel. The following steps were applied:

    Removed Invalid Rows: Filtered out non-country entities (e.g. regions or aggregates) to focus only on actual countries.

    Corrected Country Names: Cleaned country names that included illegal characters or formatting inconsistencies.

    Dropped Columns:

        country_code (no relational table used).

        years_since_century, years_since_2000 and is_pandemic_period (can be calculated if needed).

        governance_quality_index (no variance in values‚Äîconstant at 0.5).

    Rescaled Percentage Columns: Converted all percentage values (e.g. literacy rate, renewable energy usage) from whole numbers (e.g. 45) to true percentages (e.g. 0.45) for compatibility with Excel's percentage data type.

## 3. üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Preliminary exploration was performed to understand the structure and trends in the data. This included:

    Reviewing summary statistics (mean, median, null counts, etc.) in Power Query.

    Assessing data completeness across years and indicators.

## 4. üìä Visualisations and Reporting

### Several basic visualisations were created to explore development patterns:
    In Excel I made:
    
        Treemaps for:
            Population by Region (2020)
            Population by Income Group (2020)

        Pivot Tables + Sparklines for:
            Life Expectancy over time (2000‚Äì2019) for countries averaging over 50M in population.
            Inflation Rates for the same subset.

        Combo Chart (Column + Line) for:
            UK‚Äôs CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita (tons) vs Renewable Energy % over time.
    
    I then created a general Power BI dashboard that highlights certain important indicators across the 25 countries that averaged the highest populations in the dataset.

    After that I created three additional Power BI dashboards relating to Health, Environment and Economy indicators. I created a third data table for a 100% stacked area chart that shows CO2 emissions over time for the top 5 emitting countries (2000-2020).

## 5. üõ† Tools Used

    Microsoft Excel: Core tool for transformation, analysis, and visualization.
    
    Power Query: For data loading, cleaning, and transformation.

    Power BI: Snazzier visualisations that allow you to isolate more populous countries and understand their key development indicators.
    
    Kaggle: Data source.

## 6. üìå Next Steps (Planned)

    Analyse which indicators best explain Life Expectancy in R and use them for prediction.

## 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

    The dataset contains missing or interpolated values in some indicators.

    No external validation was performed on the accuracy of reported values.

    Indicators are analyzed in isolation (so far) unless explicitly correlated in visualisations.
